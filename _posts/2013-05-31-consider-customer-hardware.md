__Tl;Rr__ During development, don't forget to try out the app on an old, average system. Your customers aren't all cowboys with macbooks and Chrome.

Psst, that's awesome your sweet HTML5 canvas swoosh animation runs under 1msec. However, that fast dev machine could be screwing you. Do all your customers have solid state Macbook Airs and access your webapp via Chrome?

A large monitor, SSD drive and fast processor make development
pleasureable and fast; there's certainly nothing wrong with having the best hardware available to speed up development time. However, picture this:

Customers are accessing your webapp over a crappy connection, with
5 year old hardware... also IE.

The wonderful freedom of the World Wide Web also comes with an increasingly varied array of devices/screensizes and JS runtimes. Knowing the customer also involves what kind of hardware, common browser version and typical connection speeds - all baseline factors
that directly impact usability and ultimate adoption during that first
shaky year. An old, $300 computer can save countless hours of troubleshooting and frustration on behalf of your users and <s>support team</s> developer-on-call. If it works there, you can be confident the experience will be as good or better for users running modern hardware. 

In closing:
####The time of users blaming their outdated computer for poor app performance has passed. It's the software's fault for sucking.
