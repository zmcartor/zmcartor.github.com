I’ve been playing around with the Twitter Tools library for Python after being inspired by Vivek Haldar’s post: 



My bot is fairly simple and is currently hosted on my github [here][2]. Instead of using Eliza for psychoanalysis conversation, I decided to go with Cleverbot as an alternative. Cleverbot has it’s own Python API [which is pretty fun][3].

The SpeakingSecret bot is hosted on my laptop, so she might always be available for divination depending on astral connections. Be patient..

**Going further, the Python Natural Language Toolkit**

I’ve just started delving into the powerful NLTK to give this bot it’s own brain. Hooking it up to an AI like Cleverbot is fun, but I ultimately intend to create a pluggable interface that will allow different bot personalities to interact with those seeking wisdom on Twitter.
