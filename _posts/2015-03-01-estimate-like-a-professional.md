![explore every possibility in estimation](/images/estimations.jpg)

Every developer hates estimation. It's stressful to be put on the spot in a
meeting with the expectation of providing accurate estimates for a non-trivial
feature. Hastily created estimates affect more than the lives of the
development staff. On a macro scale, a team which cannot stick to their estimates
loses the faith and trust of the business it serves. Hasty estimation is the
cause of pain.

## The dreaded sprint review
A PM, or group of PMs needs to know exactly how many story points, or hours a
feature takes. All eyes are you on you. They're expecting a quick estimate
to log into their spreadsheets and deliver a final ship date to marketing by
COB. The sweat is gathers; difficult to think with everyone staring and waiting. 
Instead of thinking clearly, you blurt out "5 hours." A value large enough, you hope,
to account for the massive oversight of this terrible estimate. It's also small
enough that the PM won't challenge it as 'too big.' The meeting moves on, and 
you eventually escape.

## A constructive alternative
It's impossible to come up with good estimates on the spot without
investigating the problem space. Here's an example of howto handle a sprint
review like a real professional :

**PM** - *What's the estimate for item #12XY , implementation of new sign-in flow?*

**Dev** - "That feature directly impacts a critical path. We'll need some time to
fully investigate it's impact. I can have a estimate by tomorrow"

**PM** - *I really need something now. How about 5 hrs?*

**Dev** - "No. We need proper time to create accurate estimates. Our
estimates set the course of release and we need to be confident they are
accurate. You will have something by tomorrow" 

(continue re-iterating this point in various forms ad nauseam)

**PM** - *Ok then.*

## Spend the time
Technical things are difficult. The human mind is not suited to 
modeling complex multi-variate systems. An accurate estimate demands
spending appropriate time coding throwaway tests, psuedocode, and ensuring X
actually does talk to Y in the assumed manner. Investigate every avenue. **The
side affect of putting in the time is confidence in your estimate!** Confidence
in estimates begets confidence in the sprint timeline. A team consistently shipping when
they say they will accrues the trust and confidence of the business.
