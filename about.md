**About Myself**

I’m a pragmatic thinker who believes there is no such thing as a perfect program, just some are more optimal than others. When it comes to a problem I’m having trouble solving, I feel it’s better to take a walk in the park and let my subconscious have a crack at it. I have a wide technical skill range that includes work in the secret agent-esque world of information security, teaching and mentoring students in programming, and am involved in the Columbus start-up scene. What makes me different from ‘just another coder’ is my ability to creatively explain highly technical concepts to non-technical people. I love teaching. Each student brings their own point of view which makes me approach the subject matter in ways I would have never considered. 

**Why I love Programming**

Curiosity, the thirst for new knowledge frontiers and the primal urge to create, do and explore is my main passion.  As a young child, I spent most of my child arm deep in a tub of Legos. I never read the instructions that came with the kits, opt-ing instead  to make my own creation and indulge my own creativity. There is a piece of me inside every one of those half built Lego moon-bases and robotic tanks. This passion of designing and constructing is what has drawn me to programming. Writing a program is not unlike creating a tiny universe with its own laws, structure, and limitations. The experience of creating a vast new universe with a team of talented, dedicated developers is what I most enjoy doing. 

**What I do when I’m not programming**

Regarding myself outside of technology, I’ve taken up a number of different hobbies to occupy my time between git commits. I love learning new things and breaking ground in uncharted territory. I taught myself the basics of music theory and piano in my free time and honed my skills through instruction. I have been playing for 5 years, mostly bebop. Combining music and programming, I also indulge in creating glitchy, circuit bent instruments, synth programming and sound design. 

**What I’m Looking For**

I’m seeking the company of similarly passionate developers that I can learn from and build on. I think source code should be written for humans to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute. I hold myself accountable and my work to a high standard. I seek a place where others have the same passion for high quality software.
