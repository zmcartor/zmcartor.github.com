<p>&#187; <span><u>16 Mar 2013</u></span> &#187; <p>I have a secret , I still pay money for and read <em>paper</em> programming books.</p></p>
<p>When I’m reading a book, I’m the mood to learn something. Distractions must be eliminated. Electronic books exist on the computer, which is pretty much a massive sucking vortex of distraction.</p><p>Books dont have hyperlinks. There’s only one thing to do with a book, read it. (and maybe throw it at a raccoon. but that’s different.)</p><p>It’s impossible to cut/paste code from a paper book straight into an editor. (An urge that is sometimes hard to suppress with electronic books.) Typing in the code myself improves muscle memory and really makes the memory ‘sticky.’</p><p>Books are also fun to lend out. And if you get a bunch of them on your bookshelf, people will think you’re smart* ;)</p><hr /><h1><a class='btn btn-danger btn-large' href='/2013/03/16/we-can-do-better-no-more-debugging-with-consolelog'>We can do better.. no more debugging with console.log</a></h1>
<p>&#187; <span><u>16 Mar 2013</u></span> &#187; <p>This is an appeal to JS developers everywhere.</p></p>
<p>We can do better than console.log when debugging our code. I know how easy it is to debug via console.log and how fun it is to hit ‘refresh’ and then eagerly check the Firebug or Chrome console. I know it’s almost like being a child at Christmas : <em>“What did console-claus output for me!!”</em></p><p>Errant debug statements are always cleaned from the code before it ships, right?</p><p>(Yeah, probably…)</p><p>For fun, keep the JS console open while browsing the Internet today. Be amazed at the hidden world of errant console.log(..) calls unfolding before your eyes..</p><p>Oh, and console.log(..) crashes your shit on IE huh? That’s a real bummer.</p><h3 id='what_do_to'>What do to</h3><p><em>TL;DR - You’ll be able to debug faster and may learn a thing or two about your code.</em></p><p>A symbolic debugger offers some big advantages over console.log(..)</p><ol>
<li>The ability to see the entire runtime environment at once, including local variable values. A complete view of the execution environment, not just a slice.</li>

<li>The grind of ‘place debug code/refresh’ gets tedious and can turn into a time waster. A symbolic debugger speeds up the process through live tracing and dynamic breakpoints.</li>

<li>No extra code to clean up after debugging is complete.</li>
</ol><p>Get familiar with Firebug Script Console, or the Chrome/Safari developer tools.</p><p><strong>Chrome/Safari</strong></p><p><strong>Firebug</strong></p><h2 id='id3'>#</h2><p><span />: http://www.we-are-gurus.com/blog/1578-avoid-console-log-error-with-ie &#8220;console.log and IE&#8221; <span />: http://www.nsbasic.com/app/tutorials/TT10.htm &#8220;http://www.nsbasic.com/app/tutorials/TT10.htm&#8221; <span />: http://getfirebug.com/javascript &#8220;http://getfirebug.com/javascript&#8221; <span />: http://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Script_Panel &#8220;http://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Script_Panel&#8221;</p><hr /><h1><a class='btn btn-danger btn-large' href='/productivity/2013/03/16/there-are-no-couches-in-the-woodshop'>There are no couches in the woodshop</a></h1>
<p>&#187; <span><u>16 Mar 2013</u></span> &#187; <p>Dont waste time ‘thinking’ at a computer. Step away, and draw out the idea on paper, a whiteboard, lipstick on a mirror - whatever. This media is static - which is important if any thinking is to occur. Only after there’s something to say should the computer be in use. Remember, a computer is a distraction machine. You can’t check twitter while using a belt sander or Miter Saw.</p></p>
<p>The woodshop is for DOING things. There is a reason people don’t hang out in the woodshop on a couch chatting or browsing catalogs. Treat your time at the computer as you would sitting at a workbench. You are paid for your thoughts. It just so happens you also know howto express your thoughts as executable code to a machine.</p><hr />
